# Deploy and manage AI workloads on Scaleway infrastructure with CircleCI

This repository provides an example of how you can utilise CircleCI pipelines to manage AI/ML workloads on an external cloud provider. In this case we use Scaleway.

It is intended to be used alongside its corresponding blog post - https://circleci.com/blog/deploy-manage-ai-scaleway/.

The repository is a fork of the following project: https://github.com/CIRCLECI-GWP/circleci-ml-pipeline
